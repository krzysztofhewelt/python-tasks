# Tkinter
Extended version of [databases](https://github.com/krzysztofhewelt/python-tasks/tree/main/databases) task. Added window where we're choosing types of measurements, device and time range, and visualizing it on the charts.
We're using data from database used in previous task, filled with sample probes. 

## Used modules and database
* extended version of "databases" task
* modules: same as "databases" task and: Tkinter

## Features
 * same as "databases" task
